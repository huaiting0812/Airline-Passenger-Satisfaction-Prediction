## Motivation and Purpose

When passengers choose an airline, they consider many factors, such as in-flight meals, seat comfort, and service attitude. Identifying which factors have a strong correlation with overall satisfaction can help airlines improve their overall satisfaction ratings and attract more passengers.

It is also important to identify passengers who, despite indicating satisfaction with the airline in survey responses, have predicted outcomes that are neutral or dissatisfied. By further understanding this group of passengers, airlines can determine whether these are prediction errors or if they are potentially dissatisfied customers. In doing so, airlines can make corresponding improvements and genuinely cater to the needs of each passenger.
